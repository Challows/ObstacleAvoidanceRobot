# About
Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot. The application of the Obstacle Avoiding robot is not limited and it is used in most of the military organizations now which helps carry out many risky jobs that cannot be done by any soldiers.

# **Details**

The basic principle behind the working of ultrasonic sensor is to note down the time taken by sensor to transmit ultrasonic beams and receiving the ultrasonic beams after hitting the surface. Then further the distance is calculated using the formula. In this project, the widely available HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is used.

**Components Required**
- Arduino Mega or Uno (any version)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LM293N Motor Driver Module
- 5V DC Motors
- Battery
- Wheels
- Chassis
- Jumper Wires

# **Assembly**

The chasis comes with a manual for assembly which you can use to get your robot all set up.
Below are images you can use to assemble

# Applications
- Obstacle avoiding robots can be used in almost all mobile robot navigation systems.
- They can be used for household work like automatic vacuum cleaning.
- They can also be used in dangerous environments, where human penetration could be fatal.
